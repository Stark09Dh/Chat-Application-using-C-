# **Simple Chat Application in C++**  

A lightweight **client-server chat application** built using **C++ and socket programming**. This project enables **real-time messaging** between multiple clients and a server over a network.  


## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Start the server** on a system to listen for incoming client connections.  
2. **Clients connect** to the server and start exchanging messages.  
3. The server **relays messages** between clients, allowing seamless chat.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **C++** for core logic  
- **Socket Programming (TCP/IP)** for communication  
- **Multi-threading (`std::thread`)** for handling multiple clients  
- **Linux/Windows support**  

## 🌟 Future Improvements  
- 🔹 **Encryption** for secure messaging.  
- 🔹 **User authentication** system.  
- 🔹 **GUI version** for a better user experience.  

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-application.git
   cd chat-application
